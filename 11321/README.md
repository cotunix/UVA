I enjoyed this one. I grow to like the solutions I use that use language constructs that other people may not know to make the solution easier. In this case, it was passing in a lambda function into std::sort to sort a list, which was how I sorted the list. It was pretty simple, but it took an extra submission because I had forgotten that the modulo of negative numbers was also negative. Thankfully the problem description mentioned that or I might have missed it. The problem itself would probably be more difficult if one had to manually sort.
