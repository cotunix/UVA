This one took some thinking to get a start on, but once I had the solution in my head it was pretty easy to implement. Once again sacrificing some memory to help runtime significantly, I calculated all the almost primes in range and ran through all of them to make the final calculations. Getting the runtime down was hard at first but once I organized it like this it sped up quite a bit.
