This one was also pretty difficult. As the pattern with most my solutions, the initial solution wasn't too bad to figure out, but my runtime was way too far off. It took several optimizations to get runtime down to acceptable levels. The first of which was initializing the ArrayList to the correct value (really important), before this it would go over the runtime limit before even finishing reading in the values. The second of which was making the loop break as early as possible, which I did by reverse sorting the array and then by doing the arithmetic in reverse, that is making i the max rather than temp. This sped it up significantly as well, but was still not enough. Surprisingly enough, and also something I did not know about Java, was the runtime performance increase of using BufferedReader rather than Scanner for I/O. Since scanner goes to the file rather than buffering data, it was way slower. This gave me the runtime boost I needed. Even people online said it wasn't a huge difference between them and some even said that Scanner was better so I didn't implement that at first, but after optimizing literally everything else, this was the final choice and surprisingly the most effective. Something to keep in mind for further Java work.
