For this problem I used both my previous solution to 10055 of really fast file IO, since the problem stated there would be a large amount of input, as well as the sorting algorithm knowledge from 464. Since they stated there was a max of 100 different values, counting sort seemed to be the best way to sort the values. I also tried to make a good runtime for this program, so I coded it entirely in ANSI C in order to get every single bit on runtime out, even though there was 5 seconds of runtime to do it. Would likely be very difficult if I wasn't aware of these things to begin with.
