This one was probably the easiest solution, and yet the one I probably spent the most time on in order to get my "fast" solution. My first challenge was writing it entirely in ANSI C, since I rarely use it I thought it would be a good exercise to try. After doing that and getting a really good runtime, I thought that I should try to get a competitive runtime for this as a challenge to myself. I learned about faster file I/O through getchar_unlocked, as well as using inline functions and register values. I really tried my hardest to get the best runtime I could out of it, and I did end up being tied for 3rd for it(overall 7th)! I even tried the same strategy on the output but it made no difference. As you can tell I even used bitshift operations instead of multiplication in my fast scan int function. In my intial solution, I used a ternary statement rather than the if-block, assumning that the compiler would treat them the same, and to my surprise the if block was faster. I don't know if that's due to the online judge using -O2 rather than -O3, but it was really surprising to me. This was really fun to try to get the best optimization I could, and it's fun seeing my name on the leaderboard.
