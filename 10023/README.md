This one was statistically the hardest one I completed, with less than 25% of people completing it. Luckily I was aware of the fact that you could solve square roots by hand, although I didn't know how to do it. Then I learned about Newton's method for Square roots, and in the basic version the Babylonian method, which was what I implemented here. Again, I don't think I would be able to do this in C, thanks to the usage of BigDecimal it made my solution only have to deal with logic instead of language constructs. I'm pretty proud of this solution since there was so little success with it on the website, so knowing I'm in the minority is a good feeling. I spent the most time on this one, mostly due to learning about Newton's method so I could truly grok it, but once I did the solution came easily.
