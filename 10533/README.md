This one was probably one of the harder ones that I did. Once again, the solution itself is not that difficult, but getting the runtime down is a feat in itself. I spent a few hours trying to figure out what to do, and eventually settled on sacrificing memory to help the runtime. Once I stored the primes in an array, it sped up runtime significantly, rather than calculating primality every time. The second, and more difficult part, was figuring out the digit prime array. Once I set these two things up the runtime went down easily enough, but figuring them out was pretty tough.
