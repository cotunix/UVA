This one I had originally started out writing in C, but I quickly realized what the actual problem was. Given that C has no built in library for large integers, I decided that this would be a lot better to do in Java, since it has BigInteger. I honestly have no idea how I would do this in C, but it was pretty easy in Java. I had it set up of the classic fibonacci recursion, but that took too long so I did it in a loop instead to increase runtime. A mid-difficulty problem.
